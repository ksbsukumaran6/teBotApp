# Form1.cs Restoration Required

The Form1.cs file has been corrupted during the cleanup process. The file structure is broken with:
- Duplicate method definitions
- Missing method bodies
- Incorrect class structure
- Missing closing braces

## Recommended Action:
1. Restore Form1.cs from version control (git) if available
2. Or manually reconstruct the file by removing only the specific unwanted methods:
   - btnTestMultipleArrays_Click method
   - btnStartContinuous_Click method  
   - btnStopContinuous_Click method
   - OnContinuousResponseReceived method
   - btnStartListen_Click method
   - btnStopListen_Click method

3. Remove the _continuousResponseCount variable
4. Clean up UpdateButtonStates method to remove test/continuous/listen button logic

## Current Status:
File is in broken state and needs complete restoration before further edits can be made.
