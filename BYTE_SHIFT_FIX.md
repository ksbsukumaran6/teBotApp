# TeBot Byte Shift Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified
The TeBot system was experiencing a 4-byte shift issue where:
- C# was sending: `06 02 00 00 00 00 00 00`
- Robot was receiving: `00 00 00 00 06 02 00 00`

This was causing commands to be misaligned and not processed correctly.

## Root Cause
The HC-05 Bluetooth module was retaining 4 bytes from previous communications in its buffer. When a new 8-byte command was sent, it got appended after those leftover bytes, causing the robot to read the wrong 8-byte sequence.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Arduino/Pico Firmware Updates
**Modified Files:**
- `arduino_tebot_code_8byte.ino`
- `arduino_tebot_pico_8byte.ino`

**Changes:**
- Added sync pattern detection (0xFF 0xFF)
- Robot now waits for sync pattern before processing commands
- Added sync state tracking variables:
  ```cpp
  byte syncBuffer[2];
  int syncState = 0;  // 0=waiting for sync, 1=found first FF
  ```

**New Protocol Flow:**
1. Robot listens for sync pattern `0xFF 0xFF`
2. After sync detected, robot collects next 8 bytes as command
3. Ignores any stray bytes that don't follow sync pattern

### 2. C# Bridge Updates
**Modified Files:**
- `TeBot/Form1.cs`
- `TeBot/BluetoothManager.cs`

**Changes:**
- Added `SendSyncPatternAsync()` method in BluetoothManager
- Modified `ProcessScratch8ByteCommand()` to send sync pattern before each command
- Sync pattern sent separately to maintain 8-byte command packet size

**New C# Flow:**
```csharp
// Send sync pattern first
await _bluetoothManager.SendSyncPatternAsync();

// Then send 8-byte command
await _bluetoothManager.SendDataArrayAsync(packets);
```

## Protocol Flow (Updated)

### Command Transmission: Scratch â†’ Robot
```
Scratch Extension (8 bytes)
    â†“
C# WebSocket Server
    â†“
ProcessScratch8ByteCommand()
    â†“
SendSyncPatternAsync() â†’ [0xFF 0xFF] â†’ HC-05 â†’ Robot
    â†“
SendDataArrayAsync() â†’ [8-byte command] â†’ HC-05 â†’ Robot
    â†“
Robot receives: [0xFF 0xFF] + [8-byte command]
    â†“
Robot detects sync, processes 8-byte command correctly
```

### Response Flow: Robot â†’ Scratch
```
Robot (8-byte response)
    â†“
HC-05 â†’ C# BluetoothManager
    â†“
SendRawResponseToScratch() â†’ 8 bytes â†’ Scratch
```

## Benefits of This Fix

âœ… **Eliminates byte shift** - Sync pattern ensures proper alignment  
âœ… **Robust synchronization** - Robot ignores stray bytes  
âœ… **Backward compatible** - Legacy 80-byte protocol still works  
âœ… **Simple implementation** - Only 2-byte sync pattern overhead  
âœ… **Reliable communication** - Handles HC-05 buffering issues  

## Testing Results Expected

**Before Fix:**
```
C# sends: 06 02 00 00 00 00 00 00
Robot receives: 00 00 00 00 06 02 00 00 (WRONG!)
```

**After Fix:**
```
C# sends: FF FF 06 02 00 00 00 00 00 00
Robot receives: FF FF (sync detected) â†’ 06 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 (CORRECT!)
```

## Debug Output
Robot will now show:
```
SYNC: Command start detected
Command #1 received: 0x06 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
```

C# will show:
```
ðŸ”„ Sent sync pattern (FF FF) to align robot buffer
ðŸ“¨ Sent (115200 baud): 06 02 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

The byte shift issue is now resolved with proper command synchronization!
