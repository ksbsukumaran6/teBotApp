# TeBot Protocol Update - 8-Byte Command Support

## Problem Fixed
The C# WebSocket server was rejecting 8-byte commands from Scratch, expecting only 80-byte packets with 0xAA55 headers.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Form1.cs OnDataReceived Method
Now supports multiple data formats:

1. **8-byte commands** (NEW) - Single command from Scratch
2. **80-byte packets with headers** - Complex command sets  
3. **80-byte packets without headers** - Legacy format
4. **JSON data** - Text-based commands

### New ProcessScratch8ByteCommand Method
- ✅ **Validates 8-byte input** from Scratch
- ✅ **Logs command details** (type and parameters)
- ✅ **Sends single packet** to robot via Bluetooth
- ✅ **Waits for robot response** (1-second timeout)
- ✅ **Sends raw 8-byte response** to Scratch (no padding)
- ✅ **Proper error handling** with status updates

### Data Flow (8-Byte Commands)
```
Scratch Extension → 8 bytes → C# WebSocket Server
                                     ↓
                            ProcessScratch8ByteCommand
                                     ↓
                      Single 8-byte packet → Robot (Bluetooth)
                                     ↓
                        Robot Response (8 bytes) ← Robot
                                     ↓
                        Raw 8 bytes → Scratch (WebSocket)
```

## Command Format Support

### Input from Scratch (8 bytes)
```
[cmd_type, param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7]
```

### Output to Robot (8 bytes)
```
Same format - direct pass-through
```

### Response to Scratch (8 bytes)
```
Robot response sent directly without padding
[8 bytes from robot] = 8 bytes total
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **Simple Scratch commands** now work
- ✅ **Faster processing** - no complex packet splitting
- ✅ **Better logging** - shows command type and parameters
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - still supports 80-byte format
- ✅ **Error handling** - clear status messages for debugging
- ✅ **Shorter timeouts** - 1 second for single commands vs 2 seconds for complex

## Testing Results Expected
The error message should change from:
```
❌ Invalid data format from Scratch. Expected 80 bytes with 0xAA55 header. Received: 8 bytes
```

To successful processing:
```
📨 Received 8 bytes from Scratch - processing...
🔄 Processing 8-byte command from Scratch...
📋 Command: 0x01, Params: [50, 0, 0, ...]
✅ Robot responded with 8 bytes
```

The TeBot system now fully supports the simplified 8-byte command protocol!
