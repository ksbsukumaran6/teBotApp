# Binary to JSON-RPC Communication Fix

## Problem

The TeBot application was sending binary data packets to Scratch, which violates the protocol requirements. According to the protocol, all messages to Scratch should be in JSON-RPC format with a newline termination.

## Solution

1. **Removed duplicate command constants** in BluetoothManager.cs:
   - Eliminated redundant definitions of command constants (CMD_MOVE_FORWARD, CMD_MOVE_BACKWARD, etc.)
   - Kept only one set of command constants for clarity and to avoid compilation errors

2. **Fixed incomplete receiver handler code** in BluetoothManager.cs:
   - Completed the unfinished `TeBotReceiverHandler` method that had a dangling line
   - Added proper error handling and cleanup in the finally block
   - Ensured the method can properly handle received data from the robot

3. **Prevented binary data transmission to Scratch**:
   - Modified the `OnRobotDataReceived` method in Form1.cs to no longer send binary data to Scratch
   - Commented out `DataReceived?.Invoke(packet)` in BluetoothManager.ProcessValidPacket method
   - Replaced direct binary data sending with JSON-RPC in BluetoothManager.OnScratchConnected method
   - Added comments explaining that only JSON-RPC formatted messages should be sent to Scratch
   - Kept the event handlers for internal data handling but removed all direct WebSocket transmission of binary data

4. **Ensured JSON-RPC protocol compliance**:
   - All messages to Scratch now go through either:
     - `HandleJsonRpcRequest` → response sent as JSON-RPC with newline
     - `OnStatusJsonPushed` → sensor data sent as JSON-RPC with newline
   - The binary data path has been completely removed

## Communication Flow

The new communication flow is as follows:

1. **Robot → TeBot Application**: Binary 16-byte packets (unchanged)
   - Robot sends 16-byte packets in response to 8-byte poll commands
   - Each packet contains sensor data in the protocol-defined format

2. **TeBot → Scratch**: Only JSON-RPC formatted messages
   - Status updates: Sent via `StatusJsonPushed` event (JSON-RPC with newline)
   - Command responses: Sent via `HandleJsonRpcRequest` method (JSON-RPC with newline)
   - Binary packets are **no longer sent** to Scratch

3. **Scratch → TeBot → Robot**: JSON-RPC to binary conversion
   - Scratch sends JSON-RPC commands
   - TeBot converts them to binary 8-byte command packets
   - Binary packets are sent to the robot via Bluetooth

## Benefits

1. **Protocol Compliance**: Now fully compliant with the protocol requirements for JSON-RPC communication
2. **Better Error Handling**: Improved handling of incomplete or invalid packets
3. **Code Clarity**: Removed duplicate constants and confusing code paths
4. **Safety**: Ensures only appropriate, formatted data reaches Scratch

## Testing

To verify the fix is working correctly:
1. Check that binary data is no longer being sent to Scratch by monitoring WebSocket traffic
2. Confirm that all messages to Scratch are properly formatted JSON-RPC with newline terminations
3. Test robot control via Scratch commands to ensure the JSON-RPC to binary conversion works correctly
