# TeBot Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Completed Cleanup:

### 1. Removed Test Multiple Arrays functionality:
- Removed `SetTestButtonEnabled` method 
- Cleaned up `btnConnect_Click` to remove test button references
- Simplified connection success message

### 2. Removed Continuous Mode references:
- Cleaned up `OnScratchDisconnected` method to remove continuous mode stop logic
- Removed continuous mode checks from disconnect handling

### 3. Removed Listen-Only Mode references:
- Cleaned up `OnScratchDisconnected` method to remove listen-only mode stop logic
- Removed listen-only mode checks from disconnect handling

### 4. Fixed Structural Issues:
- Repaired broken method definitions
- Fixed duplicate `cmbDevices_SelectedIndexChanged` method
- Added missing method bodies
- Restored proper class structure

## 🔧 Still Present (UI Elements):

The following UI elements and their event handlers are still present but cleaned up:
- `btnTestMultipleArrays` button (UI element exists but no functional code)
- `btnStartContinuous` and `btnStopContinuous` buttons (UI elements exist)
- `btnStartListen` and `btnStopListen` buttons (UI elements exist)

## 📝 Core Functionality Preserved:

- ✅ 8-byte command queuing system
- ✅ WebSocket server for Scratch communication
- ✅ Bluetooth connection management
- ✅ Command processing pipeline
- ✅ Robot response handling
- ✅ Proper disconnect handling

## 🎯 Current State:

The application now focuses on the core 8-byte command protocol between Scratch and the robot, with all test, continuous, and listen-only functionality removed from the code logic. The UI buttons still exist but their functionality has been removed.

The rapid command processing issue should now be resolved with the cleaned-up, focused codebase.
